# Free-Water-Optimization

The purpose of these functions is to model the signal profile of free-water data acquired from DWI using multiple rank-2 tensors: one isotropic tensor to represent the free-water component and three anisotropic tensors to represent the signal profile of an arbitrary number of fibers in each of the Cartesian directions.
